# Simple Lex/Yacc Calculator

This is a simple calculator implemented using Lex and Yacc. It supports basic arithmetic operations, square root, exponentiation, and modulo operation.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Square Root**: The calculator can compute the square root of a number using the `sqrt()` function.
- **Exponentiation**: The calculator can perform exponentiation using the `^` operator.
- **Modulo Operation**: The calculator can perform modulo operation using the `%` operator.
- **Error Handling**: The calculator can handle syntax errors and division by zero errors.
- **Commands**: The calculator supports commands for displaying help instructions (`h`) and quitting the application (`q`).

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply enter an expression or a command. Here are some example expressions for each feature:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: 
  - Addition: `2 + 3`
  - Subtraction: `5 - 2`
  - Multiplication: `4 * 5`
  - Division: `20 / 4`
- **Square Root**: `sqrt(9)`
- **Exponentiation**: `2^3`
- **Modulo Operation**: `10 % 3`
- **Commands**: 
  - Display help instructions: `h`
  - Quit the application: `q`

Please note that spaces are not allowed in the expressions.
